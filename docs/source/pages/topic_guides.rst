What pliffy is (and what it isn't)
----------------------------------
**pliffy** is a simple plotting tool that addresses an important gap in the statistical plotting landscape. It generates difference plots for paired or unpaired data. Despite the simplicity of these plots, they have served its core contributor well for several years. The original version of **pliffy** was created in January 2017, a time when difference plots were not common in the published literature.

It is hoped that this revised version of **pliffy** can help students and researchers produce simple, clear and informative figures.

Alternatives to pliffy
----------------------
**pliffy** plots were inspired by the work of `Geoff Cumming`_. Geoff's originally generated his difference plots in Excel with the help of macros, a framework he called ESCI. Since then, his co-author `Robert Calin-Jageman`_ has published this statistical estimation-based framework in R as the `ESCI module`_ for `Jamovi`_.

The other alternative is to **pliffy** is `DABEST-python`_. As stated in the README.md, DABEST stands for Data Analysis using Bootstrap-Coupled ESTimation. It offers a wider variety of difference plots, all based on bootstap estimates.
